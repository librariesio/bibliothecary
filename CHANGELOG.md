## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

### Removed

## [14.2.0]

### Added

- In Nuget .csproj files, ignored <Reference> tags that don't have a version.

### Removed

## [14.1.0] - 2025-10-01

### Added

### Changed

- Dependencies from pom.xml without a scope will not return a "type" of nil instead of guessing "runtime".

### Removed

## [14.0.2] - 2025-07-29

### Added

- Add support in Pypi parser for PEP-751's newly official "pylock.toml" lockfile

### Changed

- Added a regression test to ensure "file" entries in Pipfile/Pipfile.lock are considered local.

### Removed

## [14.0.1] - 2025-07-24

### Changed

- Bugfix: implement Bibliothecary::ParserResult in SPDX parser too, and add an integration test.

## [14.0.0] - 2025-07-24

### Added

- Added Bibliothecary::ParserResult class, which wraps the parsed dependencies along with the project name, if it was found in the manifest. 

### Changed

- Breaking: parser methods now return Bibliothecary::ParserResult instead of an Array of Bibliothecary::Dependency
- Return project_name for maven-dependency-tree.txt and maven-dependency-tree.dot results
- Breaking: require the "platform" argument to be passed to Bibliothecary::Dependency, and update the parsers to do so.

### Removed

- Removed unused generic parser code.

## [13.0.2] - 2025-07-21

### Changed

- Handle scoped dependencies in PNPM lockfiles.

## [13.0.1] - 2025-07-03

### Changed

- Handle windows-style newlines in v1 yarn lockfiles.

## [13.0.0] - 2025-06-17

### Removed

- Removed parsing of environment.yml from Pypi parsing

## [12.3.1] - 2025-06-06

### Changed

- Handle .csproj files that begin with an <?xml> tag

## [12.3.0] - 2025-06-06

### Added

- Nuget support for <Reference> tag in \*.csproj manifests.

## [12.2.0] - 2025-05-30

### Added

- Maven parser support for maven-dependency-tree.dot file.

## [12.1.10] - 2025-05-23

### Changed

- Normalize package names in Poetry manifests, storing the original in
  Dependency#original_name if it differs. This is because Poetry normalizes/canoncalizes
  names in its lockfile according to PyPa's rules, but doesn't provide the original name.
  Storing the original_name will provide a connection from manifest to lockfile.

## [12.1.9] - 2025-05-16

## [12.1.7] - 2025-04-29

### Changed

- Include "source" field in Dependency objects from pub files.
- Include "source" field in Dependency objects from pnpm-lock.yaml files.

## [12.1.6] - 2025-04-29

### Changed

- Use JSON.parser.parse() in bun.lock parser to work around overriden JSON.parse() method.
- Don't raise an error in pnpm-lock.yaml v9 parser if devDependencies isn't found.

## [12.1.5] - 2025-03-17

### Added

- Adds alias support for PNPM lockfiles.
- Add support for bun.lock files

## [12.1.4] - 2025-03-14

- Add 'parser_options' arg to Bilbiothecary::Runner constructor.

## [12.1.3] - 2025-02-26

### Added

- Add 'local' property to dependencies from Pipfile and Pipfile.lock

### Changed

- Drop all sub-projects from list of deps in a Maven maven-dependency-tree.txt.

## [12.1.2] - 2025-02-26

### Added

- Add 'local' property to dependencies from Pipfile and Pipfile.lock

## [12.1.1] - 2025-02-21

### Added

- Add test coverage for Go 1.24's new "tool" directive.

## [12.1.0] - 2025-01-30

### Added

- Populate Bibliothecary::Dependency#source field in all parsers. This makes the source field useful when consuming
  from Bibliothecary, and removes a step from consumers having to populate this field themselves.

### Changed

- Improved Rubocop rules to make future spec changes easier via Rubocop auto-correcting formatting violations.

## [12.0.0] - 2025-01-27

### Removed

- This is a MAJOR release in that it removes support for hackage, carthage, hex, clojar, and swiftpm
  from Bibliothecary. We are no longer doing any network calls when using Bibliothecary and reimplementing
  parsing for those file types natively is non-trivial. Patches welcome :-)

### Changed

- Rewrote conda and yarn parsers to be in process vs calling out over the network

## [11.0.1] - 2024-12-20

## [11.0.0] - 2024-11-22

### Changed

- Removed lockfile_requirement from Bibliothecary::Dependency

## [10.2.4] - 2024-11-06

### Changed

- `Bibliothecary::MultiParsers::CycloneDX::ManifestEntries.full_name_for_purl` has changed to `Bibliothecary::PurlUtil.full_name`

## [10.2.0] - 2024-08-27

## [10.1.0] - 2024-07-23

### Changed

- Skip self referencing package entries in yarn v4+ lockfiles.

## [10.0.0] - 2024-07-08

  instances instead of `Hash` instances.
